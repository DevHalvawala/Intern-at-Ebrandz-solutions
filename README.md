Internship of Web Designing, UI/UX Designing and Web Development

1) UX (User Experience) Designer: uses psycology & user research to build user-centric components and 
   ensures that user interaction & journey through the app flows in the most user-friendly way possible.
   This is often paired with the....

2) UI (User Interface) Designer role: which is centered around the design of the components, rather than
   the functionality. UX wants the components & flow to be clear, functional & easily understood by users,
   whereas UI focuses on making components & touchpoints aesthetically appealing!

3) UX Engineer: this one is kind of misleading, as it's definitely more of a frontend engineer than UX role!
   The aim of this role is to bring low-fidelity prototypes built by the UX Designer to life i.e. build them 
   into working prototypes using code, So although they're likely more skilled in understanding UX Design &
   communicating with the design team than the average Frontend Developer, they're generally not actually 
   designing the prototypes themselves, just building them.
