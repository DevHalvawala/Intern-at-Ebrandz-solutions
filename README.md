Internship of Web Designing, UI/UX Designing and Web Development

1) UX (User Experience) Designer: uses psycology & user research to build user-centric components and 
   ensures that user interaction & journey through the app flows in the most user-friendly way possible.
   This is often paired with the....

2) UI (User Interface) Designer role: which is centered around the design of the components, rather than
   the functionality. UX wants the components & flow to be clear, functional & easily understood by users,
   whereas UI focuses on making components & touchpoints aesthetically appealing!

3) UX Engineer: this one is kind of misleading, as it's definitely more of a frontend engineer than UX role!
   The aim of this role is to bring low-fidelity prototypes built by the UX Designer to life i.e. build them 
   into working prototypes using code, So although they're likely more skilled in understanding UX Design &
   communicating with the design team than the average Frontend Developer, they're generally not actually 
   designing the prototypes themselves, just building them.
   
4) Web Designer: This is another confusing one, with various definitions! But generally, the role of a 
   Web Designer is mix between UX,UI and Visual Design. Occasionaly they may use HTML & CSS but generally 
   won't touch programming in Javascript. They also use tools like Photoshop to create beautiful website 
   designs for Frontend Developers to build, or they may design interfaces using no-code website builders
   e.g. Suarespace. The role tends to focus more on appearence & branding than UX, but can vary!
   
5) Frontend Developer: This role focus on building! they are generally provided with designs from the Design
   Team (incl. UI & UX), and it is then their job to bring the designs to life through code (using Javascript 
   & associated frameworks), make them interactive & ensure they have the full intended functionality! They
   sit between the Design and Backend Team, as they also work to ensure that any data required within the 
   components is passed safely & correctly to and from the backend of the applicattion, as well as any 
   external APIs etc.
